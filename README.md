# LZX Castle Series — MOUSER BOM

There are two main files in this repository:
<ul>
	<li>LZX CASTLE — MOUSER BOM.xlsx
		<ul>
		<li> A single sheet list compiled for <b>one of each</b> module in the series, with the parts visually grouped by type.
		</ul>
	<li>LZX CASTLE.xlsx
		<ul>
		<li> A multi-sheet list, organized by module. One module per sheet and unchanged regarding the original references.
		</ul>
</ul>

<br>
For the compiled list here is an explanation of the highlighted cells colour coding:
<ul>
	<li>Red     — indicates parts that have been discontinued. A corresponding substitute is highlighted on the same row.
	<li>Yellow  — indicates parts that are in their end of life cycle. These will have to be replaced in the future.
	<li>Grey    — components that are interchangeable for different visual results on the LZX Castle 101 Quad Gate.
</ul>
